		<h2>About me</h2>
		<h3>My name is Phuong, or you can call me Yoshi. I was borned in Ho Chi Minh city in a big family (big not rich meow meow!). In my childhood, I have a big passion in computer. Ironically, I have a predestined relationship with literature in almost my student time and I don't have time for researching computer. Of course, I used to be a specialized literature student in Le Hong Phong highschool for the gifted. During the final period of high school, I decided to study IT in university, a career that was completely opposite of what I had studied before. My friend just looked at me and "OMG! HOW???". During that day, although it's a bit difficult, I'm still living well with my passion and I still have a special love for computers!</h3>
